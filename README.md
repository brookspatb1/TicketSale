# TicketSale

This is a decentralized application that I put together for class. I plan on refactoring the code over time. Consider it a work in progress.

This repository comes with some react example work that will later be implemented.

I am still new to git/GitHub so there were a few mistakes I made during the original repo, but I'm learning.
